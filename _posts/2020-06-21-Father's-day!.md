title: Analysis of my dad's work

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/gold.jpg)


My dad makes gold ornaments, I remember getting ready on Sunday mornings as a kid to go with my dad to 
deliver customer orders, but spent years after that very detached from his business
being busy at school. I am very happy to finally be able to relate to his work as
a software engineer. 

This father's day I've spent some time analysing his business, hope you have fun reading it!

**How it all started?** 

My dad was learning the skill at his uncle's business and didn't see enough growth
potential, so he decided to start on his own. 
When i asked him what gave him enough confidence that he will acquire customers, he 
said his focus was on delivering good results for a few customers so they become loyal and return. 
He also said that his low living costs made the move easier.
He mentioned he had a friend who was already in business and was willing to outsource to trusted
third parties which kept him busy during the initial stages.

He very passionately said that it's a great feeling to see customers starting with small orders and 
then growing financially to make big orders. 


Let's jump into the customer journey.


**Requirements gathering:**

Requirements are usually around design, weight, durability and less service charges.
Designs can be downloaded from the web or design catalogues or pictures 
of similar orders(in most cases).

**work debt(in any form):**

Since tech debt is a big thing, i asked him if they have similar problems,
Apparenly, value of hours spent is far less than material costs, so it is easier to get 
the original material back and re-do it. 

**Experimentation:**

He said he personally tries to keep things simple and not experiment but it is common 
for people to experiment as cost of experimentation is pretty low.(material value can always be retrieved)

**Designs:**

There are jewellery designers that upload in the internet, but it is mostly one customer wanting 
to get something others have.(FOMO aka market standards :P)

**What is work usually like:**

He said it varies based on the order, I will try to summarise steps for above picture
- Gold biscuit is cut into pieces
- It is melted and turned to a sheet
- Then it's cut into required shape and drilling is done for stones
- Stones are fit
- Then it's polished

**Testing:**

He said testing happens at every stage for durability and it is important to catch issues in early 
phases.

**Peak seasons:**

He said that marriage seasons and sravana masam are peak seasons and he usually works 
longer during those and shorter normally.

**Competition:**

He said these are the factors that help to stand-out
- Customer engagement
- Faster delivery
- Quality and durability

**Migrations:**

He said almost 70% of the orders are migrations.(Changing one ornament to another)
Apparently, they can't escape migrations either.

**Cost of failures:**

Pretty low as material can be extracted and can be re-done. 
He said worst case scenario is that he doesn't make any money on the order.

**Future of work and views on automation:**

He said that it has changed a lot since he started but he doesn't see it going fully automatatic.

**What does he have to say about gold obsession?**

He is obviously happy about it(Why wouldn't he be? :P) and said he would rather be obsessed about something that 
has good value.

He said it makes customers happy to have ornaments and he said, "Son, it is what the whole world is going after".(Wisdom i guess!!)

**Conclusion:**

Hope you had fun reading it, pretty sure you can find someone you know that would love
to talk about their work and you can make them see it in a way they haven't had before.
Writing this made me learn things about my dad that i wouldn't have known otherwise.

I also hope this article makes him realise his work is as challenging as an office job that he always thought he wanted to do.

My mom also wants a mention in this article but i will probably write a new one about her cooking :P
