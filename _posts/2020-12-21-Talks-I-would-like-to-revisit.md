        <b>Title:</b> The moral roots of Liberals and Conservatives<br>
        <br>
        <b>What i like:</b><br>
        I always like talks/discussions that look for causes than being on surface.<br>
        In this talk, he gives a great insight into on role religion plays in shaping society.<br>
        His POV on Grand Canyon vs older civilisations is really interesting.<br>

        <b>What i like:</b><br>
        Oh boy! he is super funny<br>
        This talk made me realise how simple things like a notification of salary deposit can be 
        so much fun<br>
