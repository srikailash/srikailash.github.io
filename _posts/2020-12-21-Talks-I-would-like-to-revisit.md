        <b>Title:</b> The moral roots of Liberals and Conservatives
        <b>What i like:</b>
        I always like talks/discussions that look for causes than being on surface.
        In this talk, he gives a great insight into on role religion plays in shaping society.
        His POV on Grand Canyon vs older civilisations is really interesting.
