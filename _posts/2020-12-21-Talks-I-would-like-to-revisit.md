        <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_haidt_the_moral_roots_of_liberals_and_conservatives">The moral roots of Liberals and Conservatives</a><br>
        I always like talks/discussions that look for causes than being on surface.<br>
        In this talk, he gives a great insight on role religion plays in shaping society.<br>
        His POV on Grand Canyon vs older civilisations is really interesting.<br>

        <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/chieh_huang_confessions_of_a_recovering_micromanager?language=en">Confessions of a recovering micromanager</a><br>
        Oh boy! he is super funny<br>
        This talk made me realise how small details can radically change the experience<br>

        <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/kelsey_leonard_why_lakes_and_rivers_should_have_the_same_rights_as_humans">Why lakes and rivers should have the same rights as humans</a><br>
        I really like this task because it draws our attention to something that's overlooked<br>
        This talk clearly explains the reason behind major hindu traditions of praying to rivers<br>
        I come from a town next to river Godavari and once every 12 years godavari pushkaralu happen(it is believed that <br>
        a bath in Godavari during those 12days brings good fortune). Being a huge fan of swimming(indoor and river/lake) makes me like this talk even more :)<br>
