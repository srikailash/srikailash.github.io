title: A few interesting things I've read/watched
---

I am greatly inspired by Paul Graham's essays[1] and adapted his idea to share content that would be helpful to readers. I will write down here about new things i discovered and things i wish someone had told me.

<br>

<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_haidt_the_moral_roots_of_liberals_and_conservatives">The moral roots of Liberals and Conservatives</a><br>
</div>
I like that this talk is very analytical.
His insight on role religion plays in shaping society and POV on Grand Canyon vs older civilisations is really interesting.

</div>
  This post has really changed the way i look at work and career. Definitely recommed giving it a read and checking out
  her other posts.
<br>
<br>
<div>
<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/chieh_huang_confessions_of_a_recovering_micromanager?language=en">Confessions of a recovering micromanager</a><br>
</div>
This talk made me realise how small details can radically change the experience. Worth watching for the laugh!
<br>
<br>
<div>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkHvDOPNI1w">Peter Thiel on Aspergers</a><br>
</div>
Thanks to Peter Thiel and Susan Cain for shedding some light on the issue many people(me all the time during early 20s) face. Also being in engineering gave me opportunity to meet co-workers and bosses that are more on the side Peter Thiel mentions in the video.<br>
On a similar note, I read through this book: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50272271-the-hunter-gatherer-neurotribe">Gifted, geeks, aspies and other aliens in this world</a><br>
Such an extensive reserch from Andreas Hofer. Very well done and wish I had a school teacher like him!
<br>
<br>
<div>
<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/sarah_brosnan_why_monkeys_and_humans_are_wired_for_fairness/">Why monkeys(and humans) are wired for fairness</a><br>
</div>
Questioning how much we give up just because we are treated unfair is a great insight from this talk.
<br>
<br>
<div>
<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/kelsey_leonard_why_lakes_and_rivers_should_have_the_same_rights_as_humans">Why lakes and rivers should have the same rights as humans</a><br>
</div>
I really like this talk because it draws our attention to something that's often overlooked<br>
She clearly explains the reason behind major hindu traditions of praying rivers<br>
I have first-hand experience with reforms river Godavari brings to the city I'm from
<br>

<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/benjamin_zander_the_transformative_power_of_classical_music">The transformative power of
classical music</a></br>
</div>
Always been a big fan of music. This talk is very moving just like music itself is!
