        It like that this talk is very analytical.<br>
        He gives a great insight on role religion plays in shaping society.<br>
        His POV on Grand Canyon vs older civilisations is really interesting.<br>

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkHvDOPNI1w">Peter Thiel on Aspergers</a><br>
          Not once I had issues communicating with some loud mouthed extroverted person who thinks(or doesn't) AFTER speaking. There were times I thought there was something wrong with my communication style. Thanks to Peter Thiel and Susan Cain for shedding some light on the issue. Also being in engineering gave me opportunity to meet co-workers and bosses that are more on the side Peter Thiel mentions in the video :)<br>

          Questioning how much we give up because we are treated unfair is a great insight from this talk.<br>
