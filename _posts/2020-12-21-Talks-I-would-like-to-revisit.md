        I always like talks/discussions that look for causes than being on surface.<br>
        In this talk, he gives a great insight on role religion plays in shaping society.<br>
        His POV on Grand Canyon vs older civilisations is really interesting.<br>

        <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/kelsey_leonard_why_lakes_and_rivers_should_have_the_same_rights_as_humans">Why lakes and rivers should have the same rights as humans</a><br>
        I really like this talk because it draws our attention to something that's often overlooked<br>
        She clearly explains the reason behind major hindu traditions of praying rivers<br>
        I come from a town next to river Godavari and once every 12 years godavari pushkaralu happen(it is believed bath in Godavari during those 12days brings good fortune). I have first-hand experience with the reforms that brings to the city(thanks to Godavari)<br>
        Being a huge fan of swimming(indoor and river/lake) makes me like this talk even more :)<br>

          Unfair things really upset me a lot. She mentioned to question should we give up some part of our share just because we are treated unfair. Thanks a lot to her for expanding my thought process<br>
