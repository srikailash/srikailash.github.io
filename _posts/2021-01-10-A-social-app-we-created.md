Hello there, hope you are having a great start of the year 2021!<br>
Before I start with the app details I will tell you how we came up with the idea:

After graduation, I moved to Amsterdam for my first job and thankfully I had a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/arihantgupta0/">friend</a> that took off some of the social burden(aka making new friends) that comes with moving.

For my second job, I moved to Berlin from Amsterdam all by myself without knowing anyone in the city.
I tried going to meetups but I couldn't make any <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUM11goXAU">connections</a> due to topics of discussion being too broad(COVID-19 lockdown only making things worse).

This experience(or... hey, "life" in general :p) has taught me a lot. Especially the importance of social life and how it really affects your mental health. It is easy to be trapped in a feeling of not being social if you have special interests and narrow minded focus. But interests themselves can restore much needed community and sense of purpose by enabling selective socialising.

So, me and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/one.gautham/Gautham">Gautham</a> came up with the idea of an app to form exclusive online communities. Users can create communities(think online groups) with hashtags and can vouch each other for up to 3 different hashtags. Now communities are discoverable by users based on that social graph making sure right communities are found by right users.<br>
For instance, Gautham vouched me for swimming, programming and travelling. Now communities that are exclusive to programmers are discoverable for me to join.

I am happy to have worked with my high school buddy while building Leet and would love to hear stories about making new friends or finding a new interest through Leet. Among other things, this has taught me how much it takes to take a product to the finish line.<br>

Kudos to Gautham for all the amazing designs. Big thanks to Awni for working on the frontend flutter part. I worked on the backend and would be happy to discuss tech/improvements.

I will share the apk if you would like to give it a try. We are still working on refining the application, any feedback is welcome!
