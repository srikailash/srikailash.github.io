Hope you all are having a great start of the year 2021! 
Before I start with the app details I will tell you how we came up with the idea:

After I graduated, I moved to Amsterdam for my first job and thankfully I had a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/arihantgupta0/">friend</a> that took off some social burden(aka making new friends) that comes with moving. 

For my second job, I moved to Berlin from Amsterdam all by myself, 
I tried going to meetups, online apps ... but I couldn't make any <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUM11goXAU">connections</a> due to topics of discussion being too broad(COVID-19 lockdown only making things worse).

This experience(or hey, life in general :p) has taught me a lot and especially the importance of social life and how it really affects your mental health. If you have special interests and norrow minded focus, it is easy to be trapped in a feeling of being anti-social. But interests themselves can restore much needed community and purpose and I think Leet becomes a great place for those to be social in their own worlds by being selectively social.

So, me and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/one.gautham/Gautham">Gautham</a> came up with the idea of an app to form exclusive online communities based on interests. Users can vouch each other for up to 3 different hashtags and societies are discoverable based on that social graph. 
For instance, Gautham vouched me for swimming, programming and travelling. Now communities that are exclusive to programmers are discoverable for me to join.

I put the downloadable Andriod apk in the links section if you would like to give it a try. Building Leet helped me work with a high school friend and I would love to hear stories about making new friends based on a common interest or finding new interest.

Among other things, working on Leet taught me UX design is super fun and props to Gautham for amazing designs. Big thanks to Awni for working on the frontend flutter part. I worked on the backend part and would be happy to discuss tech/improvements.

We are still working on refining the application, any feedback is welcome!
