title: Learning how to learn
---

Me so far: I wanna get good at something, I will just dedicate all my time to it.

People: Hey Kailash, do you have a life?

Me: What's life??

Me again: Life is about creating memories through experiences,
I am not creating them if i dedicate all my time to learning one thing at a time. But i really like learning new things.

These are the things that i wanna keep in mind to make my learning efficient so i can have a "life"

1. Focus on the core thing that you wanna do.
This can be answered by approaching things

2. Have a strategy to measure your progress in learning
Measurement can also be time spent studying. It's important not to over-stress on results that you are looking for.

3. Do not over-learn.
Check how much you can retrieve if you have to explain this
to someone else.

4. Look at real world applications of what you are learning.
If you can visualise the theory, you can remember it very well
as we can remember pictures better.

5. Make sure you spend good amount of time on something not related to what you are learning.
