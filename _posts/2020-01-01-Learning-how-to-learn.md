title: Learning how to learn
---

Me(so far): I wanna get good at something, I will just dedicate all my time to it.

People: Hey Kailash, do you have a life?

Me(secretly wondering): What's life?

Me again(after contemplation): Life is about creating memories. I also want to create
memories outside learning things, but i really like learning.

These are a few points that i wanna keep in mind to make my learning efficient so i can also have a "life"

1. Focus on the core thing that you are looking to learn.
This can be answered by approaching material with questions.

2. Have a strategy to measure your progress in learning.

3. Do not over-learn.
Check how much you can retrieve if you have to explain this to someone else.

4. Look at real world applications or contrasting cases of what you are learning.

5. Make sure to spend good amount of time on things not related. I recognize that reading fiction made me better with memory.

6. Make sure you have proper foundation for things that you're planning to learn. You can grasp tougher things only when you are strong with fundamentals.
