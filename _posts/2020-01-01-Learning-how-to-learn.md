title: Learning how to learn
---

Me so far: I wanna get good at something, I will just dedicate all my time to it.

People: Hey Kailash, do you have a life?

Me: What's life??

Me again: Life is about creating memories. I also want to create
memories outside learning thinngs, but i really like learning.

These are the things that i wanna keep in mind to make my learning efficient so i can have a "life"

1. Focus on the core thing that you wanna do.
This can be answered by approaching material with questions.

2. Have a strategy to measure your progress in learning.

3. Do not over-learn.
Check how much you can retrieve if you have to explain this
to someone else.

4. Look at real world applications of what you are learning.
If you can visualise, you can remember it very well
as we can remember pictures better.

5. Make sure to spend good amount of time on things not related.
