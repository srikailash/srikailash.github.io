title: Learning how to learn
---

Me so far: I wanna get good at something, I will just dedicate all my time to it.
People: Hey Kailash, do you have a life?
Me: What's life??
Then Me again: Life is about creating memories through experiences, 
I am not creating them if i dedicate all my time to just one thing

I realise spending all your time on thing is counter-productive. 
and wanna keep these in mind:

1. Focus on the core thing that you wanna do.
Also make sure to spend time on things outside, that is very important for your learning as well

2. Have a strategy to measure your progress in learning 
Measurement can also be time spent studying. It's important not to over-stress on results that you are looking for.

3. Do not over-learn.
Check how much you can retrieve if you have to explain this 
to someone else.

4. Look at real world applications of what you are learning. 
If you can visualise the theory, you can remember it very well 
as we can remember pictures better.
