Things that help learning better.

1. Focus on the core thing that you are looking to learn.
This can be answered by approaching material with questions.

2. Have a strategy to measure your progress in learning.

3. Do not over-learn.
Check how much you can retrieve if you have to explain this to someone else.

4. Look at real world applications or contrasting cases of what you are learning.

5. Make sure to spend good amount of time on things not related. I recognize that reading fiction made me better with memory.

6. Make sure you have proper foundation for things that you're planning to learn. You can grasp tougher things only when you are strong with fundamentals.
