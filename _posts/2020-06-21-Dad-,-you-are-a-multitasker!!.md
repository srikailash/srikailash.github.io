title: My analysis of my dad's work

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/gold.jpg)


I remember getting ready on Sunday mornings as a kid to go with my dad to 
deliver customer orders, but spent years after that very detached from his business
being busy at school. I am very happy to finally be able to relate to his work as
a software engineer. 

This father's day I've spent some time analysing his business, hope you have fun reading it!

**How it all started?** 

My dad was learning the skill at his uncle's business and didn't see enough growth
potential, so he decided to start on his own. 
When i asked him what gave him enough confidence that he will acquire customers, he 
said his focus was on delivering good results for a few customers so they become loyal and return. 
He also says that his low living costs made the move easier.
He mentiones he had a friend who is already in business and is willing to outsource to trusted
third parties which kept him busy during the initial stages.

He very passionately says that it's a great feeling to see customers starting with small orders and 
then growing financially to make big orders. 


Let's jump into the customer journey.


**Requirements gathering:**

Requirements are usually around design, weight, durability and less service charges
Designs can be downloaded from the web or design catalogues or pictures 
of a similar orders(in most cases).

**work debt(in any form):**

Since tech debt is a big thing, i asked him if they have similar problems. 
Apparenly, value of hours spent is far less than material costs, so it is easier to get 
the original material back and re-do it. 

**Experimentation:**

He says he personally tries to keep things simple and not experiment but it is common 
for people to experiment as cost of experimentation is pretty low.(material value can always be retrieved)

**Designs:**

There are jewellery designers that upload in the internet, but it is mostly one customer wanting 
to get something that other has.(FOMO aka market standards :P)

** What is work like **

He says it varies based on the order but i will try to summarise steps for the above picture
- Gold biscuit is cut into pieces
- It is melted and turned to a sheet
- Cutting into required shape and drilling for stones
- fitting stones
- polishing

**Testing:**

He said testing happens at every stage for durability and it is important to catch it in early 
phases.

**Peak seasons:**

He says that marriage seasons and sravana masam are peak seasons and he usually work 
longer during those and shorter normally.

**Competition:**

He says these are the factors that help to stand-out
- Maintain customer engagement
- Faster delivery
- Quality and durability

**Migrations:**

He says that almost 70% of the order are migrations.(changing one ornament to another)
Apparently, they can't escape migrations either.

**Cost of failures:**

Pretty low as material can be extracted and can be re-done. 
He says that worst case scenario is that he doesn't make any money on the order.

**Future of work and views on automation:**

He says that it has changed a lot since but he doesn't see it going fully automatatic.

**What does he have to say about gold obsession?**

He is obviously happy about it(Why wouldn't he? :P) and says he would rather be obsessed about something that 
has good value.
He says it makes customers happy to have ornaments and it is what the whole world is about.(deep :P)

**Conclusion:**

Hope you had fun reading it, pretty sure you will find someone you know that would love
to talk about their work. I also hope this article makes him realise his work is as challenging 
as an office job that he always thought he wanted to do.

My mom also wants a mention in this article but i will probably write an article about her cooking :P
