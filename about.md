Hello there, thanks for stopping by!<br>
<br>
I am Kailash, I'm a software engineer. <br>

Up until now, I focussed on backend engineering. Currently enjoying
working on applications that are closer to humans than to CPU(Frontend) :D <br>
<br>
I've always hated school(YES, so much so I would put that in my bio), feeling grateful that I don't have to go to school again, haha.<br>
I work best when I can self pace or in small groups.
<br>
I really like making things better and
I'm very happy about the impact I'm able to make by working on technology.<br>
<br>
Outside work, I enjoy travelling, reading fiction, going around the city with my bike, <br>
meeting friends for coffee, learning to play the piano. I love swimming and have been doing that regularly for years.<br>
