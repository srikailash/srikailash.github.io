Hello there, thanks for stopping by!<br>
<br>
I am Kailash, I'm a software engineer. <br>

Up until now, I focussed on backend engineering. Currently enjoying
working on applications that are closer to humans than to CPU. :D <br>
<br>
I really like making things better and
I'm very happy about the impact I'm able to make by working on technology.<br>
<br>
Outside work, I really enjoy travelling, reading fiction, going around the city with my bike, <br>
meeting friends for coffee, learning to play the piano. I love swimming and have been doing that regularly for years.<br>
<br>
I recently took the MBTI personality test and figured out I'm an INTJ. Only wish i had known that before.
