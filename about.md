Hello there! thanks for stopping by!<br>
<br>
I am Kailash, I'm an indie app developer. <br>

I'm currently building a mobile application that enable people to voice tape their memories.(Think making mixtapes for your future self!). Hoping to get the app in playstore soon!<br>
<br>
I really like making things better and
I'm very happy about the impact I'm able to make by working on technology.<br>
<br>
Outside work, I enjoy going to new places, reading fiction, watching sci-fi, going around the city with my bike, meeting friends for coffee, learning to play the piano. I love swimming and have been doing that regularly for years.<br>
<br>
I've always hated school(YES, so much so I would put that in my bio), feeling grateful there is no school anymore, haha.<br>
I work best when I can self pace or in small groups.
