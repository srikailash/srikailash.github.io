Hello there, thanks for stopping by!<br>
<br>
I am Kailash, I'm a software engineer. <br>

Up until now, I focussed on backend engineering. Currently enjoying
working on applications that are closer to humans than to the CPU. :D <br>
<br>
I really like making things better and
I'm very happy about the impact I'm able to make by working on technology.<br>
<br>
Outside work, I really enjoy travelling, reading fiction, getting lost in the city with my bike, <br>
meeting friends for coffee, learning to play the piano.<br>
