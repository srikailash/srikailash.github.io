Hello there, thanks for stopping by!<br>
<br>
I am Kailash, I'm a software engineer <br>
I was very focussed on backend engineering until now, currently enjoying <br>
working on applications that are closer to humans than to the CPU. <br>
<br>
I'm very happy about the impact I'm able to make by working on technology and hoping this <br>
would continue. <br>
<br>
Outside work, I really enjoy reading fiction, getting lost in the city with my bike, <br>
meeting friends for coffee, learning to play the piano. <br>
